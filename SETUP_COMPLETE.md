## 📱 Your RingCentral SMS is Ready!

**Status:** ✅ CONFIGURED

Your SMS system is already set up with:
- Client ID: `ZfNZYTGQfR4cCYu1vugV6l`
- Server: `https://platform.ringcentral.com`
- JWT authentication configured
- From number: `+1-330-435-8686`

SMS will automatically send for:
- New bookings
- Rescheduling
- Cancellations
- 24-hour reminders

## 📅 Multi-Calendar System

Your system manages 3 separate calendars:

**Worry Free Moving Calendar:**
- All full-service moves
- Local & long-distance
- Can also handle labor-only if `USE_QUALITY_MOVING=false`

**Quality Moving Calendar:**
- Labor-only services
- Kept 100% separate
- Enable with `USE_QUALITY_MOVING=true` in `.env`

**Internal Calendar:**
- Day offs, call-offs, meetings
- Blocks time slots
- Prevents conflicts

**Smart Scheduling:**
- Checks ALL calendars before allowing bookings
- Prevents double-booking across companies
- Shows which calendar has conflicts

## ⏰ 24-Hour Reminder System

**How it works:**
1. Cron job runs every hour (automatically)
2. Checks for appointments 23-25 hours away
3. Sends email + SMS reminder
4. Includes pre-move checklist
5. Marks as sent (won't duplicate)

**You don't need to do anything!** It runs automatically when the server is running.

## 🏢 Company Configuration

Edit `.env` to control which company handles labor-only jobs:

```env
# Use Quality Moving for labor-only
USE_QUALITY_MOVING=true

# OR use Worry Free for everything (default)
USE_QUALITY_MOVING=false
```

## 📊 What Happens for Each Booking

   - ✅ Automatically sent by cron job

4. **If rescheduled:**
   - ✅ Reschedule email (old vs new time)
   - ✅ SMS notification
   - ✅ Company notification
   - ✅ Calendar events updated

## 📄 Generate BOL Documents

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/generate-bol \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookingId": "WFM-123",
    "inventoryItems": [
      {"name": "Couch", "quantity": 1, "condition": "Good"},
      {"name": "Dining Table", "quantity": 1, "condition": "Excellent"}

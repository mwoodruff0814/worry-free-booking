# Square Payment Integration - Configuration Summary

## ‚úÖ Credentials Extracted from Sarah AI

Your Square payment integration is already live and working in your Sarah AI chatbot. I've extracted the credentials and configured them for your booking system.

### **Square Configuration:**

```javascript
Application ID: sq0idp-7GJn4RN8zcdsw3S1kJaNOA
Location ID: L6WP06SMJKJSB
Location Name: Worry-Free Moving (Main)
Location Address: 11715 Mahoning Avenue, Suite D, North Jackson, OH 44451
Environment: PRODUCTION (live)
```

### **Backend API:**
```

```

## üîç What Sarah AI Already Does

Looking at your Sarah AI v3.html file, your chatbot already has:

### **1. Card on File Feature** ‚úÖ
- Customers can save payment methods securely
- Uses Square Web Payments SDK
- PCI compliant card tokenization
- Cards stored via your Vercel backend API

### **2. Payment Flow:**
1. Sarah collects booking information
2. Shows payment modal to customer
3. Customer enters card details
4. Card is tokenized by Square (client-side)
5. Token sent to your Vercel API
6. API creates Square customer and stores card
7. Returns card details (last 4 digits, brand)
8. Sarah confirms card saved successfully

### **3. Security:**
- ‚úÖ No card data touches your servers
- ‚úÖ Square handles all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ PCI DSS compliant
- ‚úÖ Tokenization before transmission

## üéØ Integration Plan for Booking System

### **Phase 1: Reuse Existing API** (Recommended)

Since your Vercel backend already has the Square integration working, we should use the same API:

**Pros:**
- Already tested and working
- Same customer database
- Consistent card storage
- No duplicate code

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In booking system, call your existing API
const response = await fetch(
    'https://worry-free-chatbot-git-master-matt-5184s-projects.vercel.app/api/square-customer',
    {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            sourceId: cardToken,  // from Square Web SDK
            customer: {
                firstName: customerData.firstName,
                lastName: customerData.lastName,
                email: customerData.email,
                phone: customerData.phone
            }
        })
    }
);
```

### **Phase 2: Admin Terminal Payments**

For manual payments in admin portal:
1. Use Square Terminal API
2. Or Square Virtual Terminal (web interface)
3. Or Square Dashboard (existing)

---

## üìã Backend API Endpoints (Vercel)

Your existing backend at: `https://worry-free-chatbot-git-master-matt-5184s-projects.vercel.app`

### **Endpoint: POST /api/square-customer**

**Purpose:** Create Square customer and save card on file

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "sourceId": "cnon:card-token-from-square",
    "customer": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "phone": "330-555-1234"
    }
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Card saved successfully",
    "customerId": "CUST-123ABC",
    "cardId": "ccof:CA4SE....",
    "cardBrand": "VISA",
    "cardLast4": "1234",
    "cardExpMonth": 12,
    "cardExpYear": 2025
}
```

        depositPaid: 50.00,
        totalDue: 450.00
    }
}
```

## üîê Security Notes

### **Access Token Location:**
Your Square Access Token is stored securely on your Vercel backend, NOT in the frontend code. This is correct and secure.

**DO NOT** put the access token in:
- ‚ùå Frontend JavaScript
- ‚ùå HTML files
- ‚ùå Client-side code
- ‚ùå Git repositories (if public)

**Access token should ONLY be in:**
- ‚úÖ Vercel environment variables
- ‚úÖ Backend API code
- ‚úÖ Server-side only

---

## üì¶ Required NPM Packages (for full backend integration)

If building additional backend features:
```bash
npm install square  # Square Node.js SDK
```

### **Immediate (Can Do Now):**
1. ‚úÖ Square credentials configured in .env
2. ‚úÖ Understand existing integration

4. Connect to existing Vercel API

### **Short Term (Next Session):**
1. Add payment modal to customer booking page

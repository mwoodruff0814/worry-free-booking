# Voice AI Update - Calendar Availability & Square Payments

## What's New

Your Twilio voice AI just got 10x smarter! Here's what changed:

### 1. Live Calendar Availability Checking
- Checks Google Calendar before confirming bookings
- Prevents double-booking automatically
- Offers morning (8-9 AM) or afternoon (1-2 PM) slots
- If date is fully booked, transfers to agent or suggests alternatives

### 2. Square Payment Collection via SMS
- After booking, customer receives SMS with secure payment link
- Links to checkout page where they save card on file
- Uses your existing Square/Vercel integration
- No charge until after move is complete

### 3. Enhanced AI Intelligence (Powered by Claude)
- **Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet** parses natural language:
  - **Addresses**: "uh 123 main street in canton" ‚Üí Clean address
  - **Dates**: "next friday" ‚Üí Actual date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - **Names**: "my name is john smith" ‚Üí firstName + lastName
  - **Emails**: "john at gmail dot com" ‚Üí john@gmail.com

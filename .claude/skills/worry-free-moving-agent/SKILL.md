```

### Phase 3: Address Collection (CRITICAL ORDER)

**IMPORTANT**: Must collect BOTH addresses BEFORE asking crew size!

Press 2 for two movers, 3 for three, or 4 for four."

## Claude Integration Points

### Address Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'address');
// Input: "uh 123 main canton"
// Output: { street: "123 Main Street", city: "Canton", state: "OH" }
```

Context: "Customer is providing an address for a move in Ohio"
Default: Assume Ohio (OH) if state not mentioned

### Date Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'date');
// Input: "next friday"
// Output: { date: "2024-12-08", dayOfWeek: "Friday" }
```

Context: Today is ${current_date}
Handle: Relative dates, specific dates, named dates

### Name Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'name');
// Input: "my name is john smith"
// Output: { firstName: "John", lastName: "Smith" }
```

### Email Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'email');
// Input: "john at gmail dot com"
// Output: { email: "john@gmail.com" }
```

### Natural Response Generation
```javascript
const response = await claude.generateResponse('confirmation', {
    action: 'booking created',
    customerName: 'John',
    date: '2024-12-01',
    time: '8:00 AM'
});
```

Temperature: 0.8 for natural variation
Style: Short, warm, conversational

## Distance Calculation

### Google Maps API (Primary)
```javascript
const distance = await calculateDistanceWithGoogleMaps(pickupAddress, deliveryAddress);
// Returns: { distance: 25.3, driveTime: 35 }
```

Endpoint: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json`
Required: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`

### Fallback Estimation
```javascript
const distance = estimateDistance(pickupCity, deliveryCity);
// City-based estimates for Ohio cities
```

**Never Fail**: Always return a distance value

## Pricing Integration

**CRITICAL**: Must use `/api/calculate-estimate` endpoint

```javascript
const quote = await axios.post('/api/calculate-estimate', {
    serviceType: serviceType === "moving" ? "2-Person Crew Moving" : "Labor Only",
    distance: distance, // Exact miles from Google Maps
    numMovers: numMovers,
    hours: estimatedHours
});
```

Present to customer: Round to nearest dollar, mention estimated hours

## Calendar Integration

### Check Availability
```javascript
const availability = await checkCalendarAvailability(date);
// Returns: { morning: true, afternoon: false, fullyBooked: false }
```

Time Slots:
- Morning: 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM
- Afternoon: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

If Fully Booked: Apologize, transfer to agent

### Create Booking
```javascript
await createCompleteBooking({
    date, time, customer, service, addresses, total, ...
});
```

Creates:
- MongoDB document
- Google Calendar event
- Confirmation email
- SMS payment link

## Error Handling

### Address Parse Fails
> "I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that address. Could you say it again slowly?"

### Date Parse Fails
> "I'm not sure I got that date right. Could you tell me again? For example, 'next Friday' or 'December 15th'."

### Calendar Fully Booked
> "I'm sorry, we're fully booked that day. Let me connect you with someone who can find an alternative date for you."

### Quote Calculation Fails
> "I apologize, I'm having trouble calculating that quote. Let me transfer you to someone who can help."

## Transfer Protocol

Transfer Number: `+13307542648`

```javascript
response.dial({ callerId: TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER }, TRANSFER_NUMBER);
```

Before transfer: Give brief summary if possible

## Call Recording

ALL calls must be recorded:
```javascript
response.record({
    recordingStatusCallback: '/api/twilio/recording-complete',
    timeout: 10,
    maxLength: 3600
});
```

## Conversation State

Store in Map throughout call:
```javascript
conversationState.set(callSid, {
    stage: 'collecting_addresses',
    serviceType: 'moving',
    pickupAddress: '...',
    deliveryAddress: null,
    distance: null,
    numMovers: null,
    customerName: null,
    email: null,
    date: null,
    estimatedTotal: null
});
```

## Performance Targets

- Response Time: < 2 seconds per interaction
- Accuracy: 95%+ for address/date parsing
- Completion Rate: 70%+ bookings without transfer
- Cost Per Call: ~$0.10-0.15

## Claude AI Integration Points

### 1. Address Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'address');
// Input: "uh 123 main canton"
// Output: { street: "123 Main Street", city: "Canton", state: "OH" }
```

**Context**: "Customer is providing an address for a move in Ohio"
**Default**: Assume Ohio (OH) if state not mentioned
**Cleanup**: Capitalize properly, add "Street/Avenue/Road" if missing

### 2. Date Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'date');
// Input: "next friday"
// Output: { date: "2024-12-08", dayOfWeek: "Friday" }
```

**Context**: `Today is ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`
**Handle**: Relative dates (tomorrow, next week), specific dates (the 20th), named dates (christmas)

### 3. Name Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'name');
// Input: "my name is john smith"
// Output: { firstName: "John", lastName: "Smith" }
```

**Cleanup**: Capitalize first letter of each name

### 4. Email Parsing
```javascript
const result = await claude.extractData(speech, 'email');
// Input: "john at gmail dot com"
// Output: { email: "john@gmail.com" }
```

**Handle**: Common patterns (at = @, dot = ., gmail, yahoo, hotmail, outlook)

### 5. Natural Response Generation
```javascript
const response = await claude.generateResponse('confirmation', {
    action: 'booking created',
    customerName: 'John',
    date: '2024-12-01',
    time: '8:00 AM'
});
// Output: "Perfect, John! Your move is all set for December 1st in the morning at 8 AM."
```

**Temperature**: 0.8 (high for natural variation)
**Style**: Short, warm, conversational

---

## Distance Calculation Protocol

### Google Maps API (Primary Method)
```javascript
const distance = await calculateDistanceWithGoogleMaps(pickupAddress, deliveryAddress);
// Returns: { distance: 25.3, driveTime: 35 }
```

**API Endpoint**: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json`
**Required**: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable
**Returns**: Distance in miles (rounded to 1 decimal), drive time in minutes

### Fallback Estimation (if Google Maps fails)
```javascript
const distance = estimateDistance(pickupCity, deliveryCity);
// City-based estimates for Ohio cities
```

**Never Fail**: Always return a distance value, even if estimate

---

## Pricing Integration

**CRITICAL**: Must use exact pricing algorithm from `/api/calculate-estimate`

### Required Data for Quote:
- `serviceType`: "moving" or "labor"
- `distance`: Exact miles (from Google Maps)
- `numMovers`: 2, 3, or 4
- `estimatedHours`: Calculated based on distance and service type

### API Call:
```javascript
const quote = await axios.post('/api/calculate-estimate', {
    serviceType: serviceType === "moving" ? "2-Person Crew Moving" : "Labor Only",
    distance: distance,
    numMovers: numMovers,
    hours: estimatedHours
});

const total = quote.data.estimate;
```

**Present to Customer**: Round to nearest dollar, mention estimated hours

---

## Calendar Integration

### Check Availability:
```javascript
const availability = await checkCalendarAvailability(date);
// Returns: { morning: true, afternoon: false, fullyBooked: false }
```

**Time Slots**:
- Morning: 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM
- Afternoon: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

**If Fully Booked**: Apologize, offer to transfer to agent for alternative dates

### Create Booking:
```javascript
await createGoogleCalendarEvent({
    date: date,
    time: timeSlot === "morning" ? "08:00" : "13:00",
    customer: customerName,
    service: serviceType,
    address: `${pickupAddress} → ${deliveryAddress}`
});
```

## Database Updates

## Error Handling & Recovery

### If Address Parse Fails:

### If Calendar Fully Booked:
> "I'm sorry, we're fully booked that day. Let me connect you with someone who can find an alternative date for you."

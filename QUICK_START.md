# Quick Start Guide

Get your custom booking system up and running in 10 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- Email account (Gmail recommended)
- Text editor

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
cd worry-free-booking
npm install
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment (3 minutes)

Create `.env` file from template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Minimum required configuration** (edit `.env`):

```env
PORT=3001

# Email - Use Gmail for easiest setup
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password

# Company email (receives booking notifications)
COMPANY_EMAIL=service@worryfreemovers.com
```

### How to get Gmail app-specific password:

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Click "Select app" â†’ Choose "Mail"
4. Click "Select device" â†’ Choose "Other" â†’ Type "Booking System"
5. Click "Generate"
6. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
7. Paste into `.env` as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

## Step 3: Start the Server (1 minute)

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Booking API server running on http://localhost:3001
ðŸ“… Appointments storage: /path/to/data/appointments.json
```

## Step 4: Test the API (2 minutes)

Open a new terminal and test:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Get available slots
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/available-slots?date=2025-10-24"
```

## Step 5: Integrate with Chatbot (2 minutes)

1. Open your `Sarah AI v3.html` file
2. Follow the detailed instructions in `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

**Quick version:**
- Copy the HTML from `booking-ui.html` and replace the Acuity container
- Copy the CSS styles
- Replace `showAcuityScheduler()` calls with `showBookingUI()`
- Add the booking JavaScript code

## Testing Your Booking System

### Test Email (Optional but Recommended)

Create a test booking to verify emails work:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/book-appointment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "email": "your-test-email@example.com",
    "phone": "330-555-1234",
    "date": "2025-10-24",
    "time": "10:00",
    "serviceType": "Test Booking"
  }'
```

Check your email for the confirmation!

### Test the UI

1. Open your modified `Sarah AI v3.html` in a browser
2. Go through the chatbot flow
3. Click "ðŸ“… Schedule with Sarah"
4. The custom booking UI should appear with auto-filled information
5. Complete a test booking

## What's Working Now

âœ… Custom booking interface (no more Acuity!)
âœ… Email confirmations with calendar invites
âœ… Auto-fill customer information from chatbot
âœ… Appointment storage
âœ… Available time slot checking

## Optional: Add Calendar Sync

### Google Calendar (10 minutes)

Follow detailed instructions in `README.md` under "Google Calendar Integration"

Quick steps:
1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable Calendar API
3. Download credentials.json
4. Run `node setup-google-auth.js`

### iCloud Calendar (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com
2. Generate app-specific password
3. Add to `.env`:
```env
ICLOUD_USERNAME=your@icloud.com
ICLOUD_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

## Next Steps

### For Production Deployment:

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment guides:
- **Vercel** (easiest, free)
- **Heroku** (easy, free tier available)
- **Your own server** (full control)

### For Development:

Use nodemon for auto-restart on file changes:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Common Issues

### "Cannot find module 'express'"
Run `npm install` in the project directory

### "EADDRINUSE: address already in use"
Port 3001 is already in use. Change PORT in `.env` or kill the process:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

### Emails not sending
- Check email credentials in `.env`
- For Gmail, make sure you're using app-specific password
- Check spam folder
- Look for errors in console output

### "credentials.json not found" warning
This is OK if you're not using Google Calendar yet. The booking system will work without it.

## File Structure

```
worry-free-booking/
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js              # Main server (starts here)
â”œâ”€â”€ booking-ui.html        # UI code to copy into chatbot
â”œâ”€â”€ services/              # Calendar and email services
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                  # Appointment storage (auto-created)
â””â”€â”€ .env                   # Your configuration (create this)
```

## Getting Help

1. Check the error message in your terminal
2. Review `README.md` for detailed documentation

## What You've Built

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You now have:

- âœ… A custom booking system (no third-party dependencies!)
- âœ… Auto-fill integration with your chatbot
- âœ… Professional email confirmations
- âœ… Calendar invites (.ics files)
- âœ… Appointment management

## Performance Tips

- Appointments are stored in JSON files (good for hundreds of bookings)
- For high volume (1000+ bookings), migrate to MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- Use PM2 in production for auto-restart
- Enable HTTPS in production (Vercel does this automatically)

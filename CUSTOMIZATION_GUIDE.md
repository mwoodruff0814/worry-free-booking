# Customization Guide - Worry Free Moving & Quality Moving

## üìß 1. Email Customization for Quality Moving

### Location
**File:** `services/emailService.js`

### What Needs Updating
Currently ALL emails say "Worry Free Moving" regardless of which company the booking is for.

### How to Fix
Update each email function to read company settings from `data/communication-settings.json`:

```javascript
// At the top of each email function, load company settings:
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const COMMUNICATION_SETTINGS_FILE = path.join(__dirname, '../data/communication-settings.json');

// In each function, determine company and load settings:
const company = details.company || 'Worry Free Moving';
const companySettings = await loadCompanySettings(company);

// Use company-specific settings:
from: `"${companySettings.companyName}" <${companySettings.companyEmail}>`,
subject: `‚úÖ Booking Confirmed - ${companySettings.companyName}`,
// Replace "Worry Free Moving" text with ${companySettings.companyName}
// Replace phone numbers with ${companySettings.companyPhone}
// Replace email addresses with ${companySettings.companyEmail}
```

### Email Templates to Update
1. `sendConfirmationEmail` (lines 54-293)
2. `sendCancellationEmail` (lines 298-332)
3. `sendRescheduleEmail` (lines 348-425)
4. `sendCompanyNotification` (lines 430-472)
5. `send24HourReminder` (lines 477-521)

### Location
**File:** `services/smsService.js`

- Use `companySettings.smsFromNumber` and `companySettings.smsFromName`
- Update SMS text to include correct company name

## üìÖ 3. Calendar Integration Company-Specific Formatting

### Location
**File:** `server.js` - Lines 199-220 (calendar event creation)

// Add to calendar event creation:
const companyColors = {
    'Worry Free Moving': '9', // Blue
    'Quality Moving': '10'     // Green
};

const eventDetails = {
    summary: `[${prefix}] ${serviceType} - ${firstName} ${lastName}`,
    colorId: companyColors[bookingCompany],

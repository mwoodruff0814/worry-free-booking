## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Backend Changes:
1. **New Module:** `services/twilioSmartVoice.js` - Smarter AI logic
2. **Database Update:** Added `getCustomerByPhone()` function
3. **API Integration:** Uses `/api/calculate-estimate` for quotes
4. **Dependencies:** Added `axios` for HTTP requests

### Pricing Logic:
- **Moving Service:** baseRate ($192.50) + (distance × $0.75) + ((crew - 2) × $55)
- **Labor Only:** baseRate ($115) + ((crew - 2) × $55) + (distance × $0.50) + travel fee
- **Service Charge:** Automatically added (14% for moving, 8% for labor)

### Booking Triggers:
When customer books via phone, these automations fire:
- ✅ MongoDB appointment created
- ✅ Google Calendar event added
- ✅ Confirmation email sent to customer
- ✅ Notification email sent to company
- ✅ Customer record created/updated in CRM
- ✅ Booking appears in admin portal

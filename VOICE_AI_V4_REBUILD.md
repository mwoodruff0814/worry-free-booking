# Voice AI V4 - Complete Rebuild (Production Ready)

## What Was Fixed

Your voice AI has been completely rebuilt from scratch to address all the issues you reported.

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Distance Calculation Fixed**
**Before:** Hardcoded estimates, often wrong ‚Üí Failed and transferred to agent
**Now:** Google Maps Distance Matrix API calculates exact distance
- Uses your `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- Returns actual miles and drive time
- Falls back to city-based estimates if API unavailable
- Never fails - always provides a number

### 2. **Flow Order Fixed**
**Before:** Asked crew size BEFORE knowing distance (wrong!)
**Now:** Correct order:
```
1. Service type (moving vs labor)
2. Pickup address
3. Delivery address
4. Calculate distance with Google Maps
5. Ask crew size (NOW we know distance!)
6. Calculate accurate quote
7. Offer to book / email / transfer
```

### 3. **Exact Pricing Algorithm**
**Before:** Estimates didn't match your pricing model
**Now:** Uses EXACT `/api/calculate-estimate` endpoint
- Same pricing as chatbot
- Same algorithm as admin portal
- Distance-based hourly rates
- Service charges calculated correctly

**Moving Service Formula:**
```
hourlyRate = baseRate (192.50) + (distance √ó 0.75) + ((crew - 2) √ó 55)
total = (hourlyRate √ó estimatedHours) + serviceCharge (14%)
```

**Labor Only Formula:**
```
hourlyRate = baseRate (115) + ((crew - 2) √ó 55) + (distance √ó 0.50)
travelFee = distance √ó 2 √ó 1.60
total = (hourlyRate √ó hours) + travelFee + serviceCharge (8%)
```

### 4. **Email Estimates Added**
**Before:** No email option - only book or transfer
**Now:** After quote, customer can:
- Press 1: Book now
- Press 2: Email quote to me
- Press 9: Speak with agent

Email includes:
- Service type
- Distance
- Estimated hours
- Total cost
- Company contact info

### 5. **Human-Like Responses**
**Before:** Robotic, repetitive phrases
**Now:** Claude generates natural responses
- Warm, friendly tone
- Conversational (not scripted)
- Uses customer's name
- Sounds like a real person

### 6. **Call Recording Enabled**
**Before:** No recording - no monitoring capability
**Now:** ALL calls automatically recorded
- Records from start to finish
- Saves Recording URL and SID
- Logs recording details
- Can be monitored later

Recording data logged:
```javascript
{
  callSid: "CA...",
  recordingSid: "RE...",
  duration: "325 seconds",
  url: "https://api.twilio.com/recordings/..."
}
```

### 7. **Calendar Integration Verified**
‚úÖ Checks Google Calendar before booking
‚úÖ Offers morning (8-9 AM) or afternoon (1-2 PM) slots
‚úÖ Prevents double-booking
‚úÖ If fully booked, transfers to agent

### 8. **Portal Updates Confirmed**
‚úÖ Creates appointment in MongoDB
‚úÖ Adds to Google Calendar
‚úÖ Sends confirmation email
‚úÖ Sends SMS payment link
‚úÖ Visible in admin portal immediately

### 9. **Claude Active From Start**
‚úÖ Parses addresses with AI
‚úÖ Understands natural dates ("next friday")
‚úÖ Extracts names correctly
‚úÖ Parses spoken emails
‚úÖ Generates human responses throughout

## üîë Required Environment Variables

Make sure these are set on Render:

### Required:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - sk-ant-api03-...
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - ACec85e63957...
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - 2558b396a87...
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - +13306619985
- `TRANSFER_NUMBER` - +13307542648
- `BASE_URL` - https://worry-free-booking.onrender.com

### Strongly Recommended:
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - For accurate distance calculation

Without Google Maps API key, it will use city-based estimates (less accurate but still works).

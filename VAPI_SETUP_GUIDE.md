## Step 1: Create Vapi Account

1. Go to [vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) and sign up for an account
2. Choose the **Pay As You Go** plan ($0.15/minute - no monthly fee)
3. Once logged in, go to **Dashboard** â†’ **Settings** â†’ **API Keys**
4. Copy your **API Key** (starts with `sk_...`)
5. Copy your **Public Key** (starts with `pk_...`)

**Save these for later - you'll need them!**

---

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file in the `worry-free-booking` directory:

```env
# Vapi AI Phone Configuration
VAPI_API_KEY=sk_your_api_key_here
VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_your_public_key_here
VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
TRANSFER_NUMBER=+13304358686

# Your server URL (Render deployment URL)
BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.onrender.com

# Admin email for daily reports
ADMIN_EMAIL=zlarimer24@gmail.com
```

**To generate a webhook secret:**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

---

## Step 3: Deploy Updated Code to Render

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Vapi AI phone receptionist integration"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Render will automatically deploy** your updated code (if auto-deploy is enabled)

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Check that the build succeeded
   - Look for this line in logs:
     ```
     ðŸ“ž Vapi AI Phone: CONFIGURED
     ```

4. **Test the webhook endpoint:**
   Open in browser: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/vapi/test`

   You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Vapi integration is active",
     "configured": true,
     "webhookUrl": "https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/vapi/webhook"

## Step 6: Configure Call Transfers

To enable seamless transfers from AI â†’ RingCentral â†’ Matt/Zach:

   - Forwarding Phone Number: `+13304358686` (your RingCentral)

2. **Set up RingCentral call queue (optional):**
   - Create a queue with Matt and Zach as members
   - Use this queue number as the transfer destination

3. **Test transfer flow:**

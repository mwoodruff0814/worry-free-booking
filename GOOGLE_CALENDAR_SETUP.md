## Troubleshooting

### "credentials.json not found"

**Possible causes:**
1. File is not in the correct location
2. File is named incorrectly
3. File has wrong extension (.json.txt instead of .json)

**Solutions:**
- Make sure the file is at: `C:\Users\caspe\OneDrive\Desktop\worry-free-booking\credentials.json`
- Make sure it's named exactly `credentials.json` (not `credentials.json.txt`)
- In Windows Explorer, show file extensions: View ‚Üí Show ‚Üí File name extensions

### "Token has been expired or revoked"

**How to fix:**
1. Delete `token.json` from the project folder
2. Run `node setup-google-auth.js` again
3. Re-authorize the app in the browser
4. A new `token.json` will be created

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"

**How to fix:**
1. Go back to Google Cloud Console
2. Go to OAuth consent screen
3. Under "Test users", make sure **matt@worryfreemovers.com** is added
4. Wait a few minutes and try again

### "The browser didn't open during authorization"

**How to fix:**
1. Look in the terminal for a URL
2. Copy the entire URL manually
3. Paste it into your browser
4. Complete the authorization process

### "Calendar events are not being created"

**Check:**
1. `credentials.json` exists in project root
2. `token.json` exists in project root
3. Server logs show "‚úÖ Google Calendar: ACTIVE"
4. No errors in server logs
5. Try creating a test booking and check server console for errors

---

## Files After Setup

Your project folder should have:

```
C:\Users\caspe\OneDrive\Desktop\worry-free-booking\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.json       ‚Üê Downloaded from Google Cloud Console
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ token.json            ‚Üê Created automatically during authorization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  ‚Üê Your configuration (already exists)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sarah-ai.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Security Notes

üîí **Keep these files private:**
- **credentials.json** - Gives access to your Google Calendar API
- **token.json** - Contains your authorization token
- Never commit these to git (already in .gitignore)
- Never share publicly
- Never send via email

---

## How It Works

1. **Booking created** ‚Üí System sends data to server
2. **Server validates** ‚Üí Checks all required information
3. **Google Calendar API** ‚Üí Creates event automatically
4. **Event appears** ‚Üí In your Google Calendar instantly
5. **All devices sync** ‚Üí Phone, computer, tablet all updated
6. **Email sent** ‚Üí Customer gets confirmation with .ics file too

---

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ Customer gets calendar invite
- ‚ùå You have to manually add to calendar
- ‚ùå Or remember to click .ics file in email
- ‚ùå Easy to miss bookings

**After (Google Calendar API):**
- ‚úÖ Customer gets calendar invite
- ‚úÖ **Your calendar updates automatically**

## Example credentials.json Format

Your `credentials.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "worry-free-booking-xxxxx",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "xxxxx",
    "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost"]
  }
}
```

**If it doesn't look like this,** you may have downloaded the wrong type of credentials. Make sure you selected **"Desktop app"** when creating the OAuth client ID.
